# Image Thresholding MATLAB Script

This MATLAB script demonstrates a simple image thresholding technique to convert grayscale images to binary images.

## Thresholding

Thresholding is a simple method of image segmentation that separates an image into a foreground and background. It's particularly useful for creating binary images from grayscale images.

### Algorithm

1. Choose a threshold value (T) between 0 and 255 for an 8-bit grayscale image.
2. For each pixel in the image:
   - If the pixel value is less than or equal to T, set it to 0 (black)
   - If the pixel value is greater than T, set it to 1 (white) or 255 (depending on the desired output format)

### Thresholding Idea

The core idea of thresholding is to simplify the image representation. It's based on the assumption that the important features in an image have distinct intensity levels. By choosing an appropriate threshold, we can separate these features from the background.

Key concepts:
- **Intensity separation**: Objects of interest often have different intensities from the background.
- **Simplification**: Reduces a grayscale image (256 levels) to a binary image (2 levels).
- **Feature extraction**: Can help in isolating specific features or objects in an image.

### Applications

Thresholding is widely used in:
- Document image analysis (e.g., separating text from background)
- Medical imaging (e.g., isolating certain tissues or structures)
- Industrial inspection (e.g., detecting defects in products)
- Computer vision tasks (e.g., as a preprocessing step for further analysis)

### Limitations

- The effectiveness heavily depends on choosing the right threshold value.
- It may not work well for images with uneven lighting or complex backgrounds.
- Information about intensity gradients is lost in the binary output.
